# The purity of methamphetamine


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



When we talk about the [[note/purity of methamphetamine\|purity of methamphetamine]], we’re actually talking about the ratio of D:L in that particular batch. This is different from the way the purity of most other drugs is measured, usually meant to indicate the ratio of active ingredients to filler/additives and byproducts.

> [!quote] “purity” means something different for meth than it does for drugs like heroin, cocaine or pressed pills. It doesn’t refer to whether adulterants like fentanyl are present in a sample of meth. Rather, it refers to the molecular structure of the meth itself.
